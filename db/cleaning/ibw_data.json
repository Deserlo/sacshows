As the years progressed, the promotions stopped , and she was bothers by her not being able to break into management-level positions.

Two years after President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802 into law, prohibiting racial, religious and ethnic discrimination in the countrys defense industry, the Laboratory started to hire black women to meet the demand for processing aeronautical research data. Urgency and twenty-four hour shifts prevailed with Jim Crow laws in place. Dorothy Vaughan was assigned to the segregated \"West Area Computing\" unit. In 1949, Dorothy Vaughan was promoted to lead the group, making her the NACAs first black supervisor, and one of the NACAs few female supervisors. Vaughan was an advocate for women of West Computing. Engineers valued her recommendations and for difficult assignments they usually requested that she handle the work. Dorothy Vaughan helmed West Computing for almost a decade. In 1958, when NACA transitioned to NASA, segregated facilities were abolished. Dorothy Vaughan and many of the former West Computers joined the new Analysis and Computation Division (ACD), a racially and gender-integrated group on the frontier of electronic computing. Dorothy Vaughan camr to be an expert FORTRAN programmer, and she also contributed to the Scout Launch Vehicle Program. Vaughan retired from NASA in 1971. (1)",

By 13, she was attending the high school on the campus of historically black West Virginia State College. At 18, she enrolled in the college itself, where she made quick work of the school\u2019s math curriculum and found a mentor in math professor W. W. Schieffelin Claytor, the third African American to earn a PhD in mathematics. She graduated with highest honors in 1937 and took a job teaching at a black public school in Virginia. When West Virginia decided to quietly integrate its graduate schools in 1939, West Virginia State\u2019s president, Dr. John W. Davis, selected her and two men to be the first black students offered spots at the state\u2019s flagship school, West Virginia University. In 1962, as NASA prepared for the orbital mission of John Glenn, Johnson was called upon to do the work that she would become most known for. The complexity of the orbital flight had required the construction of a worldwide communications network, linking tracking stations around the world to IBM computers in Washington, Cape Canaveral in Florida, and Bermuda. As a part of the preflight checklist, Glenn asked engineers to \u201cget the girl\u201d\u2014Johnson\u2014to run the same numbers through the same equations that had been programmed into the computer, but by hand, on her desktop mechanical calculating machine.  \u201cIf she says they\u2019re good,\u2019\u201d Katherine Johnson remembers the astronaut saying, \u201cthen I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d Glenn\u2019s flight was a success, and marked a turning point in the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union in space. She retired in 1986, after 33 years at Langley.  She died on Feb. 24, 2020. (1)",

When Ruby was in kindergarten, she was chosen to test to see if she could attend an all-white school. This was due to the 1954 Supreme Court ruling of Brown vs. The Board of Education that ordered all schools to desegregate. Ruby was one of six students to pass the test and her parents decided if they wanted to send her to an all-white elementary school to receive a better education. On November 14, 1960, at six years old, Ruby was the very first African American child to attend the all-white public William Frantz Elementary School. Ruby and her Mother were escorted by federal marshals to the school. When they arrived, two marshals walked in front of Ruby, and two behind. Ruby was met with racism daily while entering the school.Only one teacher, Barbara Henry, agreed to teach her. Ruby was the only student in Henry\u2019s class because all the other children had been removed by their parents. Yet, as the year went on, many families began to send their children back to school and the protests and civil disturbances ended. During Ruby\u2019s second year at William Frantz Elementary, she no longer needed to be escorted by federal marshals. In 1999, Ruby formed the Ruby Bridges Foundation in New Orleans (2)",

        "Short Biography": "Rosetta Tharpe was born in Cotton Plant, Arkansas on March 20, 1915 to her mother Katie Bell Nubin and her father Willis Atkins. Her father, though very little is known about him, likely played a musical influence on Tharpe due to his singing. Her mother played an even greater role through putting her in music education and performance at the age of 6. Her mother was affiliated with the Church of God in Christ, so Tharpe performed in church services and large revival meetings, quickly gaining some national attention within the church due to her versatility on instruments such as guitar, piano, as well as her vocals. In the 1920s, Tharpe and her mother moved to Chicago along with many other African Americans in the Great Migration. This migration mixed with Chicagos music, forming Northern Blues within Gospel music in African American churches, influencing the musical development of Tharpe. Tharpe was married to Rev. Tommy Tharpe by her mother at 19 years old, leading her to work with him within the church for four years, performing in services to many audiences. However, she realized she was being used by Tommy, so they separated and left Chicago, Tharpe leaving with her mother and headed to New York. There, she performed with elite white audiences, forcing her to change her music somewhat away from the Gospel music she once played. This change in her music was brought into controveresy but she chose to defy the conventions and continue to play. In 1938, she made a contract with Decca Records and it made her have to sing whatever was assigned. Some of the more risque songs she played offended church fans, but she eventually returned to Gospel songs. She toured in the 1940s including during the war, though usually was with male groups and sometimes broke racial conventions by playing with whites. Some of her music even began to reference events that were happening during World War Two but this eventually turned to discussing segregation. Marie Knight started a relationship with Tharpe, but it was kept secret from the public as they toured. To gain publicity, she advertised a marriage but found no one to marry until she came across Russel Morrison. Despite such beginnings they stuck together for 22 years. During that time, she performed in Great Britain and elsewhere abroad until she died in 1973 from stroke.",

In 2017, she was one of the producers of the show Daytime Talk. That same year, Hall was informed that her spot on the Today Show was being replaced by Megyn Kelly. However, she was not offered any new role at NBC for her return, so she left the network. In March 2018, Hall revealed that she was pregnant, and revealed that she was married to Steven Greener. This was despite struggles with sucessful in vitro fertilization since Hall struggled to conceive children. Her child was born on April 24 of 2019, finally bringing her the son she desired for long. She found herself from coming in on call whenever individuals from NBC called in sick until she left the network, and after a few months of searching for a good opportunity, she had decided to have a child. She pushed through what she sees as the greyness of her job search and fertility attempts and managed to make her dream come true, not just through her child, but also through starting her own talk show, the Tamron Hall Show on ABC.",

Her father and mother were both extremely young when they got married and had their first child, her mother only 15 at the time. despite such beginnings, her parents remained married until Davis fathers death in 2006. Even until the very end, Davis claims her father supported her and her family and she understands their circumstances. In school, Davis did not care much aout her appearance, focusing on being the best elsewhere. When she started her career, she faced many rejections. Davis claims that at first these rejections \"cement[ed]\" what she aready knew about herself and internalized her feelings. However, eventually, she had a breakthrough when she starred in How to Get Away with Murder. It was that job that Davis believes she was able to see all of her womanhood. It was her role as the intelligent, sexual Annalise that led Davis to question why she could not be who she wanted to be. This led her to be more sensual, confident, and engaged in what she did. In fact, when someone asked her to pray for a husband at the A Raisin in the Sun at Williamstown Theater Festival in 1999, she claims that she got down on her knees to pray. Soon after, she met her husband.

She attended the Baltimore School of Arts where she befriended the late rapper, Tupac Shakur. After temporary cameos in a handful of television shows, Smith reached her big break with her role in A Different World. As the show progressed, she found herself with increasing screentime, partly due to the vacuum of several members of the original cast leaving. This let Jada have more opportunities to demonstrate herself so that even after the show was canceled in 1993, she found her career taking off. Tupac even recommended that she audition for a role in Menace II Society. With her role in Menace II Society, Smith entered the film industry and found herself with many more roles such as in Jasons Lyric (1994), Set It Off (1996), The Nutty Professor (1996), Scream 2 (1997), and Return to Paradise (1998). These roles established Smith as a public figure in cinema, enabling her to take on more controversial movies. For example, Smith started in Bamboozled (2000), which satirized racial bias in the television industry. Smith also served as the voice for the hippopotamus in Madagascar and the corresponding sequels, she costarred in Reign Over Me (2007) and The Women (2008). Smith also directed and wrote an independent feature titled The Human Contract. Until her role in Magic Mike XXL (2015), Smith was largely absent from the big screen. During this time, she starred in television shows such as Hawthorn (2009), which earned her an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress. After her brief stint in television, she pivoted her career back toward the R-rated movie industry and took on a role in Bad Moms and in the comedy hit Girls Trip (2017). Recently, Smith is most known for her television show, Red Table Talk, which is designed for the women in her family to have \"authentic conversations\", with their guests, and to discuss the topics that have personally affected her family.",

She did not significantly participate in sports when young, but she followed her brother to join the track team when she was in 9th grade. During tryouts, she confused her coach, who believed that the distance was too small due to her abnormally quick time. After confirming the distance from the paces of the others, the coach asked her to run again. Once more, she amazed her coach with her amazingly fast time. Thus began Allysons running career. Just 10 weeks later, she would find herself qualified for the state competition where she was the only freshman and earned 7th place, catching the eyes of the local media. She went on to win other state titles during her high school career as well as setting new records such as a high school record of 22.51 for the 200-meter race. She even broke the under 20 record for the 200-meter witha  time of 22.11 seconds. She started college in 2003 at the University of California in order to pursue her athletic career. However, she never ran for her university since she soon signed on with Adidas, disqualifying her from running for her college but exposing her to more competitions and resources to support her career. With the upcoming 2004 olympics, Allyson began significant preparations, leading her to develop excercise induced asthma. However, she qualified for the olympics and was permitted to use a respirator to enable her to run. She, at 18 years old, competed in the 2004 olympics and earned a silver medal for thw 200 meters.

It is uncertain which day exactly she was born, but the African American Registry considers her date of birth as being September 12, 1840. She was born to Henry Irving Patterson and Emmeline Eliza Patterson. Her father actually had been friends with Andrew Johnson, who would become president, during childhood, though her father was a bricklayer. In 1852, Pattersons family left North Calorina, either due to escaping slavery or due to being freed. Eventually, the family would settle in Ohio; the town of Oberlin to be exact. in Oberlin were many free black families and Oberlin college admitted its first black student a few decades ago. So, in 1857, Patterson was able to enter a year long preparatory course at the college, but this led into entering the four-year long gentlemans course to earn a bachelor of arts degree. There, she studied Greek, Latin, and mathematics among other subjects. Despite such opportunities, Patterson still struggled against prejudice within Oberlin college, with Emma Brown, one of her classmates, noting the deceptive prejudice at Oberlin. Despite this, Patterson graduated with the highest honors and earned her B.A. From there, Patterson entered teaching, though had to change positions often and sought to help other African-American women, moving to Philadelphia to assist with the Female Department of the Institute for Colored Youth. In 1869, she moved to Washington DC to teach at the one-year Preparatory High School for Colored Youth and which would soon become Dunbar High School. Patterson then became principal of the school in 1871. She faced further struggles such as being demoted to give Richard T. Green, the first Black Harvard graduate her role, but she eventually regained her own role when Green left with only a year as principal. In the role in which she served, she started a highschool commencement, added a teacher training program, and increased enrollment to 172 students. She resigned in 1884 because she had helped make the school allegedly too big according to the administrators who believed a male was required to lead the school. Despite such discrimination, she continued to educate at Preparatory High School until she died in 1894.",

From her teens, she knew she wanted to become a nurse, leading her to work at the New England Hospital for Women and Children for 15 years. She worked in many different roles such as janitor and cook, and as a nurses aide, which allowed her to gain experience in nursing despite having no formal nursing education. In 1878, the hospital admitted her to their nursing program. The program spanned 16 months. Out of Mahoneys cohort of 42 students, only 4 were able to complete the program, including her. This made Mahoney the first African-American in the US to have earned a license for professional nursing. However, Mahoney found that public nursing had severe discrimination against her, naturally due to her being the first. Thus, she sought instead a private nursing career where she took care of many wealthy white families and gained a reputation of her abilities and manners at the bedside. In 1896, she joined the American Nurses Association, but she found it unwelcoming to African-American nurses, so she co-founded the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses in 1908. She also became the director of the Howard Orphanage Asylum for black children from 1911 to 1912. Afterward, she retired, though she did participate in one of the first womens votes in 1920 after the ratification of the19th amendment. She fought breast cancer for 3 years until she died in 1926.",

        "Short Biography": "Alice Dunnigan was born on April 27, 1906, in Russellville, Kentucky to Willie and Lena Pitman. Her father was a tobacco sharecropper and her mother did laundry. When she was four years old, she entered school one day per week, allowing her to learn to read before starting first grade. This developed her skills in the English language, and at 13 , she wrote one sentence lines for her local newspaper. These experiences helped develop her writing abilities despite only having 10 years of education in the segregated school system of her town. In 1925, she tried marrying a tobacco farmer but found herself burdened by the agricultural field. After she left the marriage, she took courses from Tenessee A&I University in journalism, and taught at the same time. But as she taught, she realized that students were not aware of the contributions of African-Americans to their state, so she prepared fact sheets to add to the texts in school. In 1936, Dunnigan was a freelance writer and enrolled in statistics and economics at Howard University. In 1946, she obtained a writer position at the Chicago Defender, eventually gaining a capitol press pass. She was the first to earn a Congressional press pass, which allowed her to sit in and report on the happenings of Congress. In 1948, she was one of the few African Americans and women to be on the press corps for Truman, which enable her to continue to ask questions regarding the Civil Rights Movement. Despite facing racial challenges, such as being barred by whites only rules, she gained a full time position in Lyndon B. Johnsons campaign in 1960. She went on to work for Johnson as his information specialist from 1966-1967. She retired in 1970 and wrote A Black Woman\u2019s Experience: From Schoolhouse to White House in 1974 and compiled her fact sheets about African-American contributions to Kentucky in The Fascinating Story of Black Kentuckians in 1982.",

Her father occassionally worked as a railroad porter and did odd jobs in between while her mother worked as a maid. At four years old, Rudolph contracted polio, which weakened her left leg. She underwent extensive therapy in Nashville, where she saw segregation in its fullest. She had to be fitted with a brace due to her weakened leg, but she despised it, so she took it off in secret and tried walking normally. She had an intense desire to be seen as healthy and walk without needing a brace, so she continued struggling at it. During this time, she attended school, which she loved and found herself accepted in. Her efforts eventually paid off when she was able to take off the brace at 11 years old, which allowed her to progress rapidly, becoming one of the fastest at her school. She was able to get into the basketbal team, which led her to join the track team where, at one time, she won every race out of twenty. She attended a track camp that was run by someone who refereed a basketball game of hers who noticed she had great running talent. In 1956, she qualified for the Olympics in Melbourne where she won a bronze for the 4 x 100m. In 1958 she enrolled in Tennessee State University. She made a world record for the 200m in the Olympic Trials, allowing her to compete in the Rome 1960 Olympics. There, she won three golds, despite having twisted her ankle the night before one of them. She also won every event in which she competed in the British Empire Games. She retired from sports in 1963 and worked as a teacher for some time before in 1967 working on Operation Champion where she trained young people in sports in poor inner-city areas. She started the Wilma Rudolph Foundation to help amateur athletes. She was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame, the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, the Helms Hall of Fame, the Womens Sports Foundation Hall of Fame, the Black Athletes Hall of Fame, and earned the National Collegiate Athletic Associations Silver Anniversary Award.

Bryant is most known for her nonprofit organization, Black Girls Code, which focuses on providing technology and computer programming education to African-American girls. She founded Black Girls Code after her daughter expressed an interest in learning computer programming, but the available courses in the Bay area were not well-suited for her: mostly boys, and rarely had other African American girls attending.

        "Short Biography": "Amy Sherald was born on August 30, 1973, in Columbus, Georgia to Amos P. Sherald III and Geraldine W. Sherald. Sherald was always drawn to art, but it was not until her school trip to a museum when she realized she could transform her passion for art into a profession. In 1997, Sherald earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in painting at Clark-Atlanta University, and in 2004, she received her graduate degree at the Maryland Institute College of Art. In the same year, Sherald suffered a life-threatening heart condition, cardiomyopathy, but continued her studies and graduated successfully. After college, Sherald moved to South America to work as an art museum curator and exhibit organizer. Then, in 2012 when Amy was 39, she underwent a successful heart transplant. After her surgery, Sherald refined her painting style, which typically featured common male, female, young, and old African American subjects. Her paintings include stylized, figurative paintings of vibrantly dressed individuals rendered in grayscale skin tones against flat, highly-saturated backgrounds that evoke a sense of timeless identity. Through these portraits, Sherald explores alternate narratives of blackness through the exclusion of color from the notion of race. The pinnacle of Sherald\u2019s career came in 2017 when Michelle Obama hand-selected her to paint her official portrait for the National Portrait Gallery. Currently, Sherald works in her Baltimore, Maryland studio.",

        "Short Biography": "Born in 1753 in West Africa, Phillis Wheatley was the first published African-American woman poet. At age seven or eight, Phillis was sold into slavery. In July 1761, the schooner Phillis docked in Boston Harbor after more than a year\u2019s voyage to and from Africa in search of captives to be sold in the slave markets of the New World. Here, Phillis was purchased by the wealthy Boston merchant John Wheatley as a slave for his ailing wife Susanna. The Wheatley family taught Phillis, who was quick to learn, how to read and write in both English and Latin. They recognized Phillis\u2019s natural talent in writing poetry early, and continually encouraged her to write more. In 1773, Phillis traveled to London with her master\u2019s son to seek publication for her work. During this time, her work received praise from many prominent people, including George Washington and African-American poet Jupiter Hammon. Wheatley was emancipated shortly after the publication of her first book. Within a year, Wheatley married a free black man named John Peters and gave birth to three children. Wheatley ultimately succumbed to her declining health and her sorrow from losing her children in December 1784. Before she died, Wheatley hoped to publish her second volume of poetry, but unfortunately could not find enough subscribers to publish. These works have since been lost. Wheatley\u2019s poetry recounts the trauma of her abduction and subsequent containment while crossing the Atlantic. She also used her writing as a way to attack the prevailing white colonial assumption that Africans were destined for slavery. Wheatley left an incredibly poetic legacy that has paved a way for her to assume her rightful place in the center of the American literary canon.",
        "Death": "12/05/1784",
        "For the culture": "Phillis Wheatley was the first African-American woman to publish a book of poems. Her book displayed a degree of genius and talent arguably unequalled anywhere else in the Americas of her day and so extraordinary as to evoke more than two centuries of both praise and controversy.",
        "Notable Events": [
            "At fourteen, Wheatley published an elegy \"On Messrs Hussey and Coffin,\" and an elegy \"On the Death of the Rev. George Whitfield,\" which drew the attention of both Boston and London audiences (1770)",
            "Wheatley published a small, but remarkable volume of poetry titled Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral twelve years after her arrival in the Americas (1773)",
            "Wheatley\u2019s poetry was so well received it went through twelve editions by 1840, a remarkable publishing record."
        ],
        "Unique Philosophy": "Wheatley had two distinct philosophies. The first is through a careful inversion of traditional typological connotations associated with patterns of black and white, Wheatley attacked the prevailing white colonial assumption that Africans were destined for slavery because of the color of their skin. Wheatley asserts that her race is instead a \"sable race,\" thereby associating regal, rather than negative, connotations with the color black. The second is her distinction between good and bad people. According to Wheatley, good people, no matter their religious or cultural backgrounds, construct their ethics on a sound moral reality that rejects bigotry and superficial reasoning for the exploitation of others. Good people treat others well, and evil-hearted people treat others bad.",

        "Short Biography": "Born on November 3, 1970, in Syracuse, New York to Henry and Luberta Epps, Jeanette J. Epps always dreamed of working for NASA. Epps was the youngest of seven children growing up, with her twin sister, two older sisters, and three brothers. Epps always had a passion for science and math, and ultimately pursued these passions through high school and into college. In 1988, Epps graduated from Thomas J. Corcoran High School in Syracuse. She then attended LeMoyne College and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics in 1992. She then received her Master of Science in 1994 and Doctorate of Philosophy in Aerospace Engineering in 2000, both at the University of Maryland. In her professional life, Epps was always drawn to working in the scientific fields. At 16, she was a pathology intern at the New York Science Center. Then, during graduate school, Epps worked as a NASA Fellow from 1996 to 1999. Here, she researched composite swept-tip beams testing, analyzed models and data for shape memory alloys, and applied shape memory alloy actuators to track helicopter rotor blades. After graduate school, Epps worked at Ford Motor Company as a Technical Specialist in their scientific research laboratory. Her work at Ford contributed to the U.S. granting her a patent for her research in automobile collision location detection and countermeasure systems. In 2003, Epps joined the CIA in Iraq for four months as a Technical Operations Officer, where she looked for weapons of mass destruction. After seven and a half years as an analyst of foreign weapon systems for the CIA, Epps entered the agency\u2019s Directorate of Science and Technology, developing operations that allow the collection of technology-related intelligence data for the US government. NASA eventually picked Epps for its group of astronauts on June 23, 2009, where she worked on crew efficiency on the space station as a representative to the Generic Joint Operation Panel. Since 2003, Epps has received numerous Exceptional Performance Awards and has even been inducted into the Academy of Distinguished Alumini\u2019s Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Maryland.",

            "I became active in things largely because my mother was active in the field of religion. And so wherever there was a discus- sion, I'd go. It didn't matter if it was all men. . . You see, New York was the hotbed of-let's call it radical thinking. . . . Boy, it was good, stimulating. All of the churches depended, in terms of things taking place, on women, not men. Men didn't do the things that had to be done and you had a large number of women who were involved in the bus boycott. They were the people who kept the spirit going [the women] and the young people. I had known ... that there would never be any role for me in a leadership capacity with SCLC. Why? First, I'm a woman. Also, I'm not a minister ... The basic attitude of men and especially ministers, as to ... the role of women in their church setups is that of taking orders, not providing leadership. I have always thought what is needed is the development of people who are interested not in being leaders as much as in developing leadership among other people. You're organizing people to be self-sufficient rather than to be dependent upon the charismatic leader. Most of the youngsters had been trained to believe in or to follow adults ... I felt they ought to have a chance to learn to think things through and to make the decisions. I have always felt it was a handicap for oppressed people to depend so largely on a leader, because unfortunately in our culture, the charismatic leader usually becomes a leader because he has found a spot in the public limelight. It usually means that the media made him, and the media may undo him. There is also the danger in our culture that, because a person is called upon to give public statements and is acclaimed by the establishment, such a person gets to the point of believing that he is the movement. Such people get so involved with playing the game of being important that they exhaust themselves and their time and they don't do the work of actually organizing people.  Strong people don't need strong leaders. My basic sense of it has always been to get people to understand that in the long run they themselves are the only protection they have against violence or injustice .... People have to be made to understand that they cannot look for salvation anywhere but to themselves.",
            "We need to penetrate the mystery of life and perfect the mastery of life and the latter requires understanding that human beings are human beings ... a greater degree of real concentration on organizing people. I keep bringing this up. I'm sorry, but it's part of me. I just don't see anything to be substituted for having people understand their position and understand their potential power and how to use it. This can only be done, as I see it, through the long route, almost, of actually organizing people in small groups and parlaying those into larger groups ... I knew from the beginning that as a woman, an older woman, in a group of ministers who were largely as supporters, there was no place for me to come into a leadership role. The competition wasn't worth it."

        "Short Biography": "Some called her \"Fundi,\" a teacher of great wisdom, a Swahili word meaning a person who teaches a craft to the next generation. Others called her \"Mama Baker\" (Grant, 1981). Her entire adult life was devoted to building organizations that worked for social change by encouraging individual growth and individual empowerment. Ella Baker was a central figure in Afro-American activism as an organizer and as an\nadvocate of developing the extraordinary potential of ordinary people. She was associated with whatever organization in the Black community was on the cutting edge of the era. She was valedictorian of her class at Shaw University in 1922/1927. She had been protesting the schools restrictive dress code for students and its policy of having students sing Negro spirituals for visitors. Between 1929 and 1932, she was on the editorial staffs of at least two newspapers, the American West Indian News and Negro National News. She spent about half of each year organizing membership drives and new chapters in the South-Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and Virginia as the assistant field secretary of the NAACP.  With SNCC, she helped organize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (FDP), a vehicle to give the poor of that state some political voice. She also helped organize the challenge FDP made at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. She had a significant influence on the early leaders of SDS (Students for a Democratic Society), which in its early years adopted a style of work that duplicated the style she encouraged SNCC to adopt. She was involved with attempts to reform urban schools, with South African support groups, with Third World womens organizations, and attempts to organize poor whites in the South.",
        "Death": "12/13/1986",
        "For the culture": "She was able in 1944 to initiate a series of leadership conferences. The conferences, one of which was attended by Rosa Parks, were intended to help local leaders search for more effective ways to attack local problems and at the same time see how local issues were, inevitably, expressions of broader social issues. Baker worked with Rosa Parks in the Montgomery NAACP office on a Leadership Conference project. The program was designed to develop leadership skills in local NAACP members. Problem-solving skills were honed, and participants were encouraged to discover solutions to community problems.",
        "Notable Events": [
            "In 1935 Miss Baker herself pretended to be a domestic worker in order to investigate the employment conditions of Black domestics. In the early 1930s, in one of her first efforts at implementing social improvement, she helped organize the Young Negroes Cooperative League, which was created to form cooperative groups that would pool community resources and thus provide less-expensive goods and services to members.",
            "In 1943 she became the NAACP's National Director of Branch. Unhappy with the bureaucratic nature of the NAACP and newly responsible for the care of her young niece, she resigned from her director position in 1946 but worked with the New York branch to integrate local schools and improve the quality of education for black children. In 1955, the mayor of New York City asked her to serve on the Commission on School Integration. Baker called meetings all over the city and encouraged parents to sign petitions protesting segre- gation in the school system.",
            "In the mid-1950s (1955), with Bayard Rustin and Stanley Levison, she helped organize In Friendship, an organization that offered eco-nomic support for Blacks suffering reprisals for political activism in the South. This same group helped develop the idea of a mass- based organization to continue the momentum that came out of the Montgomery bus boycott. From that idea, developed by several groups almost simultaneously, grew the Southern Christian Lead- ership Conference. The initial meeting of the embryonic SCLC was called by the Reverend C. K. Steele, one of the contacts Baker had made in the South, and it was the In Friendship group that encouraged Steele to call the meeting. Baker was key in preventing an internal dispute from splinter- ing the organization. By 1961 a split had developed between those who wanted the organization involved in voter registration work and those who wanted it to continue in the direct-action tradition in which it had been born. Ella Baker's advice was ordinarily couched in questions, but this time she interceded more directly, suggesting that the students compromise by developing programs in both areas. She left the SCLC in 1960 to help student leaders of college activist groups organize the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). With her guidance and encouragement, SNCC became one of the foremost advocates for human rights in the country.  Baker helped run a clearinghouse in Washington, D.C., to help build support for a group that was bound to run into massive resistance."

        "Relationships to other figures in Black History": "Bob Moses, Rosa Parks, Amzie Moore, Reverend Charles Kenzie Steele, Bayard Rustin, George Schuyler, A. Philip Randolph",
        "Unique Philosophy": "As an activist she self-consciously saw herself as a bridge across the sharpening social class divisions in the Black community. By her own interpretation, having been raised where there was a pervasive sense of community among Blacks \"helped to strengthen my concept about the need for people to have a sense of their own value and their strengths and it became accentuated when I began to travel in the forties for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. If there is one idea that seems central to her approach, it may be the idea of group-centered leadership rather than leader-centered group. In contrast to the more tradi- tional conception of leadership as moving people and directing events, hers was a conception of leadership as teaching, a concep- tion that changes the nature of what it means to be success.  Baker insisted that people help themselves and discover solu-tions to problems. Baker supported group-centered leadership. She believed that natural resistance already exists and that no person wants to be set up. To her way of thinking, strong people did not need strong leaders. Baker was of the opinionthatthe media make leaders and can undo them. She abandoned the traditional NAACP strategy of appealing to the professional ranks and the notion that the \"talented tenth\" would lead the masses. She wanted regular folks to become involved and wanted programs created to challenge people to begin helping themselves. Baker's philosophy was \"Power to the People.\" She believed that, through combined effort and inner strength, the people could accom- plish much. She insisted that nobody was going to do for people what they had the power to do but had failed to accomplish themselves. Baker was committed to the idea that everyone should be prepared to take on leadership to effect change in their lives. She demonstrated this philosophy in her attempts to consciously and consistently develop and use programs that, at their core, encouraged an inclusive model of leadership. An advocate of citizenship schools, she encouraged the SCLC to recognize the importance of adult education in preparing African Americans to fully exercise their rights in a democratic society.  Baker was fond of using the Socratic method. She asked ques- tions and the students discovered answers. They debated for hours, and meetings could last for days. If someone remained quiet for too long, Baker would engage the person in conversation and then announce to the group that he or she had something to say. The students trusted her because, rather than dictate policy, Baker guided them to solutions. She spoke their language (Dallard, 1990).  ",

            "I was as strong, if not stronger, than any of them ... When we got there, instead of treating me and Mom like somebody who called the cops for help, they treated me like I'd killed somebody. Mr. Dick was in his forties and I was only ten. Maybe the police sergeant took one look at my breasts and limbs and figured my age from that, I don't know. Anyway, I guess they had me figured for having enticed this old goat ... So I asked him to play 'Trav'lin' All Alone.' That came closer than anything to the way I felt. And some part of it must have come across. The whole joint quieted down. If someone had dropped a pin, it would have sounded like a bomb ...  What can I tell them? If you find a tune and it's got something to do with you, you don't have to evolve anything. You just feel it, and when you sing it other people can feel something too ... I wanted her (Bessie Smith) feeling and Louis' (Armstrong) style ... Tain't whatcha do, it's the way thatcha do it ... It wasn't the pneumonia that killed him, it was Dallas.. where he walked around from hospital to hospital trying to get help ... I've made lots of enemies, too ... Singing that hasn't helped any ... The germ of the song was in a poem by Lewis Allen ... When he showed me that poem, I dug it right off. It seemed to spell out all the things that had killed Pop. Allen had heard how Pop died and of course was interested in my singing. He suggested that Sonny White, who had been my accompanist, and I turn it into music. So the three of us got together and did the job in about three weeks. But as Holiday wrote in her autobiography, even there she was afraid to sing Strange Fruit and regretted it at least momentarily when she first did. There wasn't even a patter of applause when I finished ... Then a lone person began to clap nervously. Then suddenly everybody was clapping ... Did you hear that bartender ringing the cash register all through? ... He always does that when I sing ... After two shows of this I was ready to quit ... I knew if I didn't, the third time round I might bounce something off that cracker and land in some San Fernando ranch-type jail ... It means when the crackers are killing the niggers. It means when they take a little nigger like you and snatch off his nuts and shove them down his goddamn throat. That's what it mean.... That's what they do. That's a goddamn pastoral scene."

        "Short Biography": "Billie was among American musicians who led in the Diaspora of Jazz. She was named Eleanora but changed it to Billie (after the actress Billie Dove). Billie grew up in a rich musical environment and, at an early age, began singing for night-world audiences. While Billie and her mother moved to New York City during her later adolescence, Billies Baltimore musical background was the foundation that facilitated her entrance into the skilled artistic, New York environment of her father. She helped with chores in the local whorehouse in exchange for the privelege of listening to Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong records on the Victrola there. \nShe said she was influenced by Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith.  Shortly after she got out of jail she auditioned for a job as a dancer at a bar called The Log Cabin but she was so bad. It wasnt too long after that that John Hammond \"discovered\" her at The\nLog Cabin and it was through him she got to know many of the musicians she ended working with. She became well-known in the New York\nclubs in her early twenties. She also made recordings then with Benny Goodman, Lester Young, Roy Eldridge, to name a few. Then she decided she wanted to make more money and went on the road with Count Basie and later on with Artie Shaw. After she returned to the New York clubs (she was getting booked into classier joints then) she enjoyed increasing popularity. She is also known as Lady Day (nicknamed by Lester Young). Like any revolutionary act, \"Strange Fruit\" encountered great resistance. Holiday was abused, sometimes physically, by irate nightclub patrons. Columbia Records, Holidays label in the late 30s, refused to record it; even progressive radio stations would not play it. And, again like revolutionary acts, the song has generated its fair share of mythology, none more enduring than Holidays oft-uttered claim that she partly wrote it herself or had it written for her. \n\"Strange Fruit\" marked a watershed, praised by some, lamented by others, in Holidays evolution from exuberant jazz singer to chanteuse of lovelorn pain and loneliness. Once she began to sing it, some of the songs sadness seemed to cling to her. Everytime she sang it she would have to run to the bathroom immediately afterward and vomit. Holiday referred to in contemporary press accounts as the \"buxom, colored songstress\" or \"the sepian songstress.\" Harpers Bazaar heralded Holiday as \"a high priestess of swing.\" Like all jazz masters and artists during her lifetime, Billie served out her jazz apprenticeship in \"The Jazzmans True Academy\" jam sessions. After Billie began singing in Harlem back rooms and after-hour nightclubs, before being hired as lead vocalist for jazz ensemble recordings, she was accompanied by her father to daily jam sessions of the Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, and Fess Williams bands.",
        "Death": "12/17/1959",
        "For the culture": "Before Billie Holiday was twenty-five years old, her vocal art, heard on stage or on recordings, extended the blues tradition, charted a course for modern jazz singing, and influenced instrumental jazz and American popular music. Prior to jazz ensemble recordings with Billie as lead vocalist, jazz artists were only envisioned to be instrumentalists. \nShe raised the vocal expressiveness of classic female blues artists, already renowned for their\nexpressive depth, to a highly instrumental level and fused blues and jazz in American popular songs, forever changing the course of this art form.\nBillie Holiday cut forty-nine records with Lester Young accompanying her on his saxaphone. She helped compose \"Strange Fruit\" which is the story of a lynching, and she sang it for her father who was not lynched but died of pneumonia. ",
        "Notable Events": [
            "Billie Holiday was eighteen years old in 1933 when she made her very first recording for Columbia Records. Her first appearance after she got out of Alderson was a packed concert at Carnegie Hall. Then she starred in a musical \"Holiday on Broadway\" which lasted three weeks. After this she appeared in theatres in New York and throughout the U.S. She also made a European tour which she proudly labelled \"Dream of Life\" in her autobiography. She and Edith Piaf, vocally, are the world leaders with the highest quantity of recorded songs. Most of the jazz ensemble recordings with her as lead vocalist were issued in Europe as well as in America. Billie was one of the the first African Americans to have personal contracts specifically for recording American popular songs. Billie made the first discs under her own name for Vocalion in 1936 \"Did I Remember\" and \"No Regrets.\"",

        "Unique Philosophy": "She was never a huge commercial success compared to some of her contemporaries. Perhaps this is because she never compromised her art she refused to sing a particular song in a particular way just so it would sell. Billie Holiday just sang the way she felt like singing. However, she did not imitate them (Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong, she just created a way of her own early in her career. She had limited vocal but not emotional range. And she used no tricks. She just combined her voice and her feeling and gave the lyrics her own meaning. Much of the material she recorded had corny and banal lyrics but she had the ability to emphasize what in the song meant something special to her. On one hand, she emulated the speech-song expressiveness, clear diction, blues tonality, and bending of tones (tonal variation) of classic female blues artists. On the other hand, she emulated jazz artists' impro visational dialogues, their superimposing jazz time over absolute or linear time (pulse flexibility), and their instrumental approach brass and wood wind to melodic phrasing, tone coloring, and dynamics.",

        "Short Biography": "As one of only a few successful, highly paid black actors in early Hollywood, McDaniel was seen by many as a pathbreaking pioneer. But, her willingness to portray racist stereotypes led some to cast her as a traitor. As one of thirteen children in a family of performers, McDaniel grew up watching her father struggle to find steady work and to obtain a veterans pension that was denied to him on racist grounds. Following in the footsteps of her older brothers, who saw stage work as a ticket out of poverty, McDaniel began performing as an actress and a singer at the age of eight. She sang at church, at school, and at home. Before long she was also singing in professional minstrel shows, as well as dancing, performing humorous skits, and later writing her own songs. By the time she was twenty, she was a popular local entertainer in her hometown of Denver. McDaniel began her on-stage career at fifteen, and at sixteen, she abandoned high school to enter show business. In 1910, McDaniel became a full-time minstrel performer. She found work as a ladies room attendant at a Milwaukee night club where her harmonizing convinced the owner to give her a chance out front. David Selznick, the GW producer, carefully cultivated McDaniels image as Scarletts \"Mammy\" that McDaniel found herself typecast for throughout the remainder of her career. Like many early film actors, McDaniel began her career in a vaudeville theater. McDaniels stage characters were bold and irreverent; she inflected her roles with sassy rebellion and explicit social critique. In her early career, she appeared in an all-female minstrel show where she delivered a brash, exaggerated spoof of the plantation \"Mammy\" caricature. By the 1920s, she was touring the country on a black vaudeville circuit, singing racy blues songs loaded with sexual innuendo. However, she was widely criticized for her depiction of Scarlett OHaras devoted slave, Mammy. McDaniel was the target of widespread abuse from a pre-civil rights black leadership who found her \"Mammyism\" offensive. In front of theaters, protesters carried signs reading \"Gone With the Wind Hangs the Free Negro.\" One black newspaper even wrote, \"Hattie McDaniel must go.\" Of her eighty-three screen credits, well over half preceded what was regarded as her breakthrough role in Gone with the Wind (1939). When the Depression hit and stage work dried up, McDaniel moved to Hollywood. Like most black movie performers, she signed with Charles Butlers Cinema Exchange, a talent agency. Film studios cast both black and white actors by type; heavy-set and dark-skinned, McDaniel was typed as a servant, maid, or \"mammy.\" It was only until her role of \"Beulah\" on CBS Radio in 1947 that, although still typecast as a maid, McDaniels character changed. McDaniel landed a role in Beulah, a spinoff television program, as a well-developed, strong-willed character. Two weeks after completing the first few episodes (of Beulah) she was hospitalized. McDaniel died of cancer and heart disease the next year at age fifty-seven.",
        "Death": "10/26/1952",
        "For the culture": "The first black to receive an Academy Award for her portrayal of Mammy in the 1939 film Gone With the Wind (The performance won McDaniel the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), the first to sing Denver's KOA radio station, the first admitted to the Motion Picture Home and Hospital, even the first interred in Los Angeles's Rose Cemetery. She was the first black woman to perform on American radio and among the first to star in either a radio or television series when she portrayed \"Beulah\" (a radio part originated by a white actress). To McDaniel's generation, the mere presence of blacks in Hollywood film was an important achievement. . McDaniel's presence, in the CBS radio show, boosted the show's popularity-over ten million listeners tuned in weekly-and sold sponsor Procter and Gamble's Dreft laundry soap, which McDaniel hawked in radio commercials. She also wrote dozens of show tunes such as \u201cSam Henry Blues,\u201d \u201cPoor Wandering Boy Blues,\u201d and \u201cQuittin\u2019 My Man Today.\u201d",

Dandridge was reared by her mother, Ruby Dandridge, who was an actress herself. Dorothy and her sister Vivian were a part of a singing group, the Dandridge Sisters, which was a hit in the 1930s. Tracing Dandridges career trajectory from child performer as one of the \"Wonder Children\" on the church and \"chitlin circuit,\" to musical cameos in clas- sics like A Day at the Races (1937) or Going Places (1939), to premier nightclub singer and international film star. Dandridges career in film reflected a departure from the stereotypical roles black women were offered such as mammies, servants, or tragic mulattoes. There were episodes when Dandridge integrated the top nightclub and hotel venues where she starred, but at the same time wasnt allowed to mingle with her adoring, white elite audiences, or stay as a guest in those establishments. In one insulting but comically paranoid incident, it is recounted how an exclusive hotel casino in Las Vegas, where Dandridge was the featured entertainer, drained its swimming pool when she merely hinted at taking a dip. Despite Dandridges identification with, and political commitment to, the black community she was the target of occasional essentialist snipping from the black tabloids about her inability to find a Negro lover, or her alleged detachment from black causes.",

        "Short Biography": "Althea Gibson was the first black female to compete in an integrated tennis tournament, and she was the first African American to be accepted into the USLTA championships. Born in Silver, South Carolina, and raised in Harlem, Gibson made international headlines in 1950 when she became the first black person to compete at Forest Hills, which was segregated by custom. Growing up, Gibson was a paddle tennis champion before taking up tennis. When Gibsons family could not protect her from the negative influences of Harlem, a Southern black family took her in and supported her through high school and college. Two doctors, noticing Gibsons talent and potential, brought her to their house in Wilmington, North Carolina, for schooling and coaching. After graduating high school, Gibson went to Florida A&M University on a full scholarship. With her degree in physical education, she taught at Lincoln University in Missouri for a few years. Gibson had come close to winning Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 1950, but her ability to improve was severely curtailed by a lack of funds and her lack of access to private tennis clubs and tournaments due to her race. In 1951, she integrated Wimbledon. Before breaking color barriers, she was a dominant presence in the tournaments of the American Tennis Association (ATA) in the 1940s. Gibson won the national women\u2019s singles championship of the ATA for ten consecutive years between 1947 and 1956. Officials of the ATA and USLTA privately negotiated to strategize how she might compete in the U.S. Nationals. Gibson\u2019s role in the integration of the all-white tennis circuit and her performance of middle-class black womanhood qualified her to be a goodwill ambassador. She was widely viewed as an effective parry to ripostes of racism made by communists and their fellow travelers. Gibson served as a cultural ambassador through 1959. Between February and March, she made her second and final goodwill tour for the State Department, traveling alone on a month-long engagement in Guatemala, Colombia, Peru, Haiti, Chile, Brazil, and Venezuela. When she returned to the U.S., she visited the State Department\u2019s headquarters in Washington and spoke to 600 personnel. Her visit coincided with efforts to stir interest in tennis among female employees. While abroad, she never criticized U.S. segregation. She even waited ten years to divulge that she could not work as a teaching professional at American tennis clubs because of her race. Gibson was also ostracized by many of the White players on her tour, and she frequently faced hostile crowds. As a Black female athlete, Gibson faced discrimination structured by the intersection of racism and sexism. For example, due to long-standing White supremacist beliefs about the unwomanly nature of Black females, Gibson was only allowed to participate in the U.S. national championships after she took a chromosome test to confirm she was female. It was not until the 2007 U.S. Open, 50 years after she won her first Grand Slam Singles title, that the U.S. Tennis Association saw fit to acknowledge her path-breaking accomplishments.",
        "Death": "09/28/2003",
        "For the culture": "She made international headlines in Septemeber 1950 when she became the first black person to compete at Forest Hills, which, like most other USLTA tournaments, was segregated by custom. In 1951, she integrated Wimbledon. Gibson then became the first Black to play on the distinguished grounds of Wimbledon in 1951, reaching the quarterfinals in he first attempt. Five years later, she became the first racialized minority to at Wimbledon, when she paired with Britain's Angela Buxton to capture the Women's Doubles title. Gibson burnished her reputation further in 1957 and 1958 when she won consecutive singles titles at both Wimbledon and the U.S. National Lawn Tennis Championships at Forest Hills, becoming the first African American to win either tournament. Althea Gibson, as most everybody knows, was the first African American to win both the United States Singles Championship (in 1957 and 1958) and Wimbledon (in 1957 and 1958). She won sixteen out of eighteen tournaments, although she faltered at Wimbledon and Forest Hills, losing both in the final round. It was the last time that would happen, however. In 1957, Gibson became the first African American - man or woman - to take the Wimbledon singles title. She entered the record books again in the late summer when she finally won at Forest Hills. From there, she seemed unstoppable. In 1958 she certainly was. She retained both the Wimbledon and Forest Hills titles, again entering the record books alongside the few other tennis greats who had enjoyed back-to-back wins of both tournaments.",
        "Notable Events": [
            "Gibson won the national women\u2019s singles championship of the ATA for ten consecutive years between 1947 and 1956. She won four championship titles while on a tour of South- east Asia between 1955 and 1956. She had returned to the United States after an eight-month international junket, during which she competed in twenty tournaments in India, Sweden, Germany, France, Egypt, Italy, and England. In 1956 the U.S. Department of State invited Gibson to travel to the Far East and to play in demonstration tournaments. During the Good Will Tour, Gibson had the opportunity to compete against a range of tough tennis players. In 1957 and 1958, Gibson won her first U.S. Open and British Wimbledon tournaments, and Gibson credited her wins to the challenging opponents she faced on the government- sponsored tour. She went on to become the number one player in the world. She won thirty-three titles, including sixteen in singles. Sports Illustrated credited Gibson\u2019s achievements abroad with bringing \u201can electrifying quality back to tennis.\u201d The New York Times opined that she was \u201ca good envoy for her country . . . the sort of representation that we need and want . . . not the \u2018tourist\u2019 type . . . [but] part and parcel of the real America that works for what it gets and plays hard and well to win.\u201d Gibson\u2019s play during the tour upstaged her teammates. She was the only member to win multiple titles, taking the women\u2019s singles and the mixed-doubles in the Indian Nationals and the women\u2019s singles and doubles in the Asian Championships. Gibson\u2019s triumphs were interpreted as being as significant for her nation as much as they were for her race. Gibson further distinguished herself in Pakistan as a model of unconventional American womanhood. When she defeated Richardson and Perry in a game of pool, her defeat of the men drew local comment, remarked a State Department employee: \u201c[T]his was . . . the first time in the history of Pakistan that a woman had ever been seen in a pool room.\u201d She also beat a Pakistani man in a one-set exhibition match. \u201cHe was so covered with confusion that he promptly presented her with his prize tiger skin rug,\u201d the employee recounted. Gibson\u2019s status as a highly valued State Department athlete was confirmed when Dulles presented her with the winner\u2019s silver plate at Forest Hills, in September 1958. Gibson was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 1971 and received numerous awards."

        "Relationships to other figures in Black History": "Jackie Robinson, Alice Coachman, ",
        "Unique Philosophy": "As the foster child and prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of black professionals, she learned that self-presentation was integral to her rep- resentation of blacks. Gibson was largely committed to adhering to the standards of black female respectability. Indeed, she described herself as a tomboy who found dresses and skirts cumbersome and for whom sport was a form of self-expression. She promoted tennis as beneficial for everyone, no matter their age or gender, and discussed how sports had improved her own social standing. While abroad, she never criticized U.S. segregation. Gibson was also careful never to speak of her intersecting problems with race and gender. She did not tell global audiences about the pressure the black press placed on her to represent the race well, aesthetically and athletically, on the tennis court, including sexist insults that she was \u201cso busy collecting tennis trophies all over Europe she hasn\u2019t had time for hairdressers,\u201d in 1956. Gibson enjoyed the travel immensely and felt grateful for the opportunity both to develop her skills and to see the world. Gibson nonetheless chose to handle her success in her own way, which was to shy away from any role as a race hero. ",

        "Short Biography": "Lorraine Hansberry was the first black playwright and the youngest of any color to win the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for the Best Play of the Year for her first play, A Raisin in the Sun. Hansberry was born on the South Side of Chicago into a middle class family. While she was privy to opportunities denied to others, her family still encountered many obstacles. For example, for her family to purchase a home in a previously all-white neighborhood, her father had to wage a legal battle all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. When the family finally moved in, the home was attacked by a racist mob; a brick hurled through the window narrowly missed the eight-year-old Lorraine. Earlier she lived in a ghetto, the product of rigid housing segregation which kept all blacks, regardless of income, confined to the same neighborhood. When she went to school, she made friends with the other black children whose families were not as well off as hers, and she never forgot the lessons she learned from them. She attended the University of Wisconsin, but left shortly to find an education of a different kind. Moving to New York City, Hansberry took a job as a journalist on the black paper FREEDOM. Here, she began to refine her writing skills and came to know some of the greatest black literary and political figures of her time: W. E. B. Du Bois, Paul Robeson, and Langston Hughes. They became the artistic and philosophical reference points for her later works. Although her plays are not autobiographical, except To Be Young, Gifted and Black, the origins of their themes can be found in several facets from her youth. According to Hansberry, the truth and essence of her life  begins in the Chicago ghetto where she was born. Her brief life yielded five plays (one of which was completed by her former husband and literary executor, Robert Nemiroff) and more than sixty magazine, newspaper articles, plays, poems, and speeches. She also wrote the text for The Movement, a photographic essay on the Civil Rights Movement. To Be Young, Gifted and Black toured the country after her death, playing to thousands on campuses and in communities, adding a new and vital phrase to the American idiom. As an activist artist, Hansberry spoke at Civil Rights rallies writers conferences, and she confronted then-U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy in a controversial meeting with black leaders about the role of the FBI in the Deep South. Hansberry is important because of her incisive, articulate, and sensitive exposure to the dynamic, troubled American culture. She could tell painful truths to a society unaccustomed to rigorous self-criticism. Hansberry, whose 1959 play Raisin in the Sun won the New York Theater Critics award and was then made into a Hollywood movie, would have been an attractive subject for a USIA film, but Hansberrys work in the early 1950s for the left-leaning magazine Freedom, edited by Robeson, was deemed so radical that Hansberrys achievements were highlighted in USIA materials.",
        "Death": "01/12/1965",
        "For the culture": "The drama, which opened on Broadway in 1959, was a landmark success and was subsequently translated into over thirty languages on all continents,including the language of East Germany's Sorbische minority, and produced in such diverse countries as Czechoslovakia, England, France, and the Soviet Union. Les Blancs is the first major work by a black American playwright to focus on Africa and to pose this question in the context of an African liberation struggle. Its existence marks Hansberry as a visionary who accurately read the signs of her times and foreshadowed the impending African struggle for liberation. The play also forces a reassessment of the term terrorist, which has become a meaningless label that masks the desperation and sometimes the inevitability of violence.",
        "Notable Events": [
            "The play (A Raisin in the Sun) became a popular film in 1961 and a Tony Award-winning musical in 1973. As a young college student, she had wandered into a rehearsal of Sean O'Casey's Juno and the Paycock. Hearing in the wails and moans of the Irish characters a universal cry of human misery, she determined to capture that sound in the idiom of her own people-so that it could be hear by all."
        ],
        "Relationships to other figures in Black History": "W. E. B. Du Bois, Paul Robeson, and Langston Hughes, Julius Lester, Julian Mayfield, Alice Chidress, Michael Anderson,  John O. Killens, Douglas Turner Ward, Louis E. Burnham",
        "Unique Philosophy": "From her parents she learned to have pride in the family and never to betray the race. But she had also learned that freedom and equality for her people were not likely to come through the American democratic way. She had seen her father spend a small fortune fighting the restrictive covenants of Chicago, then die a permanently embittered exile in a foreign country, having seen few results from his efforts. She had little desire for the materialism characteristic of her class since her kindergarten days when she was beaten up classmates: Her mother had dressed her in white fur\u2014in the middle of the Depression. She came to respect the pugnacity of her peers, children from the ghetto who were not afraid to fight and to defend themselves. From these and other early experiences she developed a deep empathy for the desires and frustrations of her people, and a respect for their beauty and vigor. FREEDOM editor, Louis Burnham, she would credit with teaching her \"that all racism was rotten, white or black; that everything is political; that people tend to be indescribably beautiful and uproariously funny. He also taught me that they have enemies who are grotesque and that freedom lies in the recognition of all of that and other things.\" It was at this point in her life that she consciously decided to be a writer. As a black writer, Hansberry was caught in a paradox of expectations. She was expected to write about that which she \"knew best,\" the black experience, and yet that expression was doomed to be called parochial and narrow. Hansberry, however, challenged these facile categories and forced a redefiniton of the term \"universality,\" one which would include the dissonant voice of an oppressed American minority. One of the most fundamental illusions of her time and culture, she believed, is the idea that art is not and should not make a social statement. Isolation is the enemy of black writers, Hansberry believed; they are obligated to participate in the intellectual and social affairs of human-kind everywhere. Hansberry's \"sighted eyes\" forced her to confront fully the deparavity, cruelty, and utter foolishness of men's actions, but her \"feeling heart\" would not allow her to lose faith in humanity's potential for overcoming its own barbarity. This strong and uncompromising belief in the future of human kind (in The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window play) informed her plays and sometimes infuriated her critics. This strong affirmation of life in the face of human frailty and cosmic absurdity was unusual in the world of profes sional theatre, but very consistent with the beliefs of Lorraine Hansberry. In play after play, she sensed the mood of her times and anticipated the future\u2014the import ance that African politics and styles would assume, the regeneration of commitment among American intellectuals, the seductiveness of mercenary values for black Americans, and the proliferation of liberation struggles throughout the world. The theatre was a working laboratory for this brilliant woman whose sighted eyes and feeling heart caused her to reach out to a world at once cruel and beautiful. Absorbing the views of the Communist left of the post-World War II era, particularly those of Paul Robeson and W. E. B. Du Bois, and coupling these with her personal abhorrence of war and violence, she expressed a commitment to peace that was evident from the Progressive Party campaign OF 1948. Her focus on opposing U. S. Cold War policies - including support for European colonialism, the war in Korea, and the buildup of nuclear weapons - was of necessity combined with opposition to McCarthyist measures intended to silence such opposition. Hansberry was not alone in making a long-term com- mitment to the \"fight for peace\" (as it was called during the 1948 presidential campaign), and recognizing the way in which she and her contemporaries linked peace and freedom enriches their legacy. Hansberry's interest in and activities on behalf of peace reflect her ties to the Communist left during the early years of the Cold War.  The views of radicals such as Hansberry, who cared deeply about the liberation of black people but saw this issue as inseparable from other pressing concerns. Hansberry's belief in humanity and in the need to change social structures that prevented each individual rom reaching his or her full potential meant that for her peace depended on justice, and together these served as the overarching issues undergirding her creative work. Hansberry brought her own definition of universalism, her \"deep desire for a new world,\" and her revulsion at the horrors of war and violence. In her later positions can be seen both the political legacy of the Communist movement, especially the views of Robeson and Du Bois, and her personal, emotional commitment to peace. In Hansberry's view, issues of peace a racial discrimination, nuclear weapons, were all connected. ",

        "Short Biography": "Josephine Baker is best known as the young black entertainer from St. Louis, Missouri, who took Paris by storm in the 1920s. To French audiences, Baker seemed to embody the primitive sexual energy of black art and music that would energize European culture. In France, Baker also had to cater to white fantasies about race. In the black review that brought her to Paris at the age of nineteen in 1925, Baker danced in a number called \"Danse Sauvage,\" set in an African jungle. In her opening performance at the Folies Bergere the next year, Baker did the Charleston dressed only in a skirt of bananas, a costume that would become her trademark. Eventually, however, Baker was able to transcend racial stereotyping in France and to play the music halls descending long staircases in elegant gowns in the kind of role previously reserved for white stars. Bakers glamorous life in Paris was a stark contrast to her early years in St. Louis. Her family had been so poor that she and her brother would search for coal that had fallen off a conveyor belt in the freight yards in order to heat their home. For a time, the family of six slept in one bed. At the age of eight, Baker became a live-in housekeeper for a woman who beat her and made her sleep in the basement with a dog. She gained an early love for the theater, perhaps because it was an escape from the difficulties of her young life. She later explained that she danced to keep warm. Racism shaped Bakers early memories. When interviewed in 1973 by young Henry Louis Gates, Jr., about her life, Baker began with memories of the 1917 race riots, which occurred when she was eleven years of age. The East Saint Louis riots\nwere violent and deadly, and in her autobiography Baker described atrocities she witnessed as she fled the burning city. Yet the riots occurred in East Saint Louis, across the Mississippi River from Bakers own home. The stories of the riots were seared in Bakers memory; so horrified was she that she remembered the riots as if she had been there herself. In Paris, Baker was generally free of the day-to-day insults of American-style ra- cism. She lived a glamorous life-style free from racial segregation. Like many other African Americans, she found the city a haven in the years between the two world wars. In 1937, after marrying a Frenchman, Baker finally adopted her new nation by becoming a citizen of France. She began a career in show business as a child. Her first notable appearance was as a chorine in Sissle and Blakes Shuffle Along, 1921. Her career also included appearances in films. During the early 1950s, Josephine Baker was an international star who lived in a castle in France, who wore Dior gowns in concert, and whose most radical political idea seems to have been a hope that the world might some day live in racial har- mony. She would hardly seem a threat to the national security of the United States. Nevertheless, during the early fifties, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) kept a file on Baker, and the State Department collected data on her activities, using the information to dissuade other countries from allowing her to perform. Baker was caught in the cross fire of the Cold War in Latin America in the early 1950s. The woman lauded in Havana and Miami in 1951 as an international star was arrested by the Cuban mili-tary police two years later as a suspected Communist, but she had undergone no radical political transformation in the interim. EntertainerJosephine Baker posed a special problem for the government. During her international concert tours in the 1950s, she harshly criticized American racism. The United States government could not restrict her travel by withdrawing her pass- port because she carried the passport of her adopted nation, France. Early in Bakers professional life, her energies were focused primarily on the theater and on developing herself as a star. Her emphasis changed in 1939 when France declared war on Germany. Using contacts she had in the Italian embassy, Baker began doing intelligence work for the Allies and spending much of her time with refugees from the war. Knowing that black entertainers would be unable to work in occupied France and fearing Nazi racism, Baker fled to the south of France and, ultimately, to North Africa. While\nstill in France she joined the Resistance and, using her performance tours through Europe as a cover, participated in relaying information on Axis troop movements to the Allies. She wrote information in invisible ink on her musical scores and then passed on the scores. Later in North Africa she was hospitalized for nineteen months with peritonitis; only barely recovered, she found the energy to perform for Allied troops. Bakers war work was in part motivated by her loyalty to her adopted country; at least as important,\nin fighting Nazism she was fighting racism. The struggle against racism and a search for universal racial harmony would be a driving force in her life in later years. In 1948, Josephine Baker sailed to New York, hoping to gain the recognition in the country of her birth that she had achieved in France. She had returned to the United States to appear in the Ziegfeld Follies in 1935 but had received devastating reviews. In 1948 as well, she did not find the critical acclaim she had hoped for; what she did find was racial discrimination.  Baker, however, would speak about justice at a press conference in the afternoon and then don a feathered gown and headdress for the evening show. She was lauded for demanding racially integrated audiences. While Baker did not overtly address race relations in her performances, the per- formances themselves in some ways crossed racial boundaries. This woman, who first appeared on Broadway in blackface in a caricatured black production, had replaced\nfloppy shoes and a plaid dress with jewels and designer gowns. In the place of crossed eyes were now eyes that looked out from behind a curtain of mascara. Bakers mere acceptance by American theatergoers in the postwar years marked a cultural transi-\ntion from the narrow roles for black women in the 1920s to the possibility of stardom. Baker also reconceptualized the image of black entertainers in a more fundamental way.",
        "Death": "04/12/1975",
        "For the culture": "Baker was a hit in Miami. Baker was also praised for insisting on an integrated audience. Following her success in Miami Beach, Baker signed contracts for performances throughout the United States; she always required that audiences be integrated and that she receive accommodations in first-class hotels. Baker was hailed by the African-American press for her efforts. Josephine Baker's civil rights work extended beyond theater. She urged business leaders in Chicago and San Francisco to hire more African Americans. She assisted the family of Willie McGee, an African American executed for allegedly raping a white woman, by paying for his funeral; and she stopped in at a racially charged trial of the Trenton Six to cheer up the defendants, African-American men accused of murdering a white shop owner. Baker personally tried to intergrate a whites-only soda fountain at the Hecht department store in Washington, D.C. The New York Amsterdam News reported that Baker told the store manager refusing her service, \"Washington is the capital of the world and should be an example of a living democracy.\" The article continued, \"She also reminded the manager of the Negro boys who are dying in Korea for a democracy that their people can not enjoy.\"",

            "She went to Paris in 1925 and became one of France's great music hall stars, appearing first in \"La Revue Negre,\" then in Folies Begere, and other revues. She returned to the United States several times; in 1936, when she appeared in the Ziegfeld Follies and toured; in 1958; and in the 1970s. For her work for the Resistance, Baker was awarded the Cross of Lorraine by Charles de Gaulle in 1943, and in 1961 she was awarded the Legion of Honor and the Croix de Guerre in recognition of her wartime service to France. She and her white husband, Jo Bouillon, were refused service by thirty-six New York hotels. Baker then decided to see for herself what life was like for an average African-American woman in the South. Leaving her husband behind, she traveled south using a different name, and she wrote for a French magazine about such experiences as getting thrown out of white waiting rooms at railroad stations. Becoming Josephine Baker again, she gave a speech at Fisk University, an African-American school in Tennessee, and she told the audience that her visit to Fisk was the first time since she had come to the United States that she felt at home. After this trip, she told a friend that she would dedicate her life to helping her people. In December 1950, she received a telegram in Havana from a New York agent who offered her a \"tremendous\" salary for an engagement at the Copa City Club in Miami Beach. She asked an American newspaperman, \"What is Copa City and what is its policy concerning Negroes?\" He told her that it was probably the most luxurious nightclub in the country and that no African Americans had ever been admitted as guests. \"Then the whole idea is ridiculous,\" she said. The next day, Baker was visited by Ned Schuyler, co-owner and general manager of Copa City. He had seen her Havana show, and he thought it was \"the most magnificent and sensational act in show business.\" He told Baker, \"I've just got to have you for my club.\" She declined, saying, \"I cannot work where my people cannot go. It's as simple as that.\" After some negotiating, Schuyler offered Josephine Baker a contract with special provisions: \"It is understood and agreed between both parties that patrons are to be admitted regardless of race, color and creed.\" Baker then made sure that the audience would be integrated. She had Schuyler fly in African- American and white celebrities from New York for her opening. When she went on stage at the Copa City, Baker told her audience that it was the most important moment of her life. In 1954, Baker and Bouillon began adopting children of various races and religions. The \"Rainbow Tribe,\" as she called them, grew to twelve children. Baker hoped that her family would demonstrate that people of different races and religions could live in harmony. She would return to perform in the early 1960s and to participate in the 1963 March on Washington, then a tired and aging, though still very popular, performer. She was honored for these and other efforts when the New (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) held \"Josephine Baker Day\" on May 20, 1951."

        "Relationships to other figures in Black History": "Jeanetta Welch Brown,  Vivian Carter Mason, Willie McGee, Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr., ",
        "Unique Philosophy": "Baker was seen as a threat because she used her international prominence to call attention to the discriminatory racial practices of the United States, her native land, when she traveled throughout the world. Her seemingly simple campaign for racial tolerance made her the target of a campaign that ultimately pushed her from the limelight of the exclusive club cir- cuit to the bright lights of a Cuban interrogation room. EntertainerJosephine Baker posed a special problem for the government. During her international concert tours in the 1950s, she harshly criticized American racism. The United States government could not restrict her travel by withdrawing her pass- port because she carried the passport of her adopted nation, France.  In 1950 and 1951, Baker scheduled a tour of Latin American countries but made no plans to visit the United States. She was a smash hit in Cuba; agents and club operators in the United States then became interested in booking her. She declined their invitations, saying she was not interested in performing in theaters with ra- cially segregated audiences. Baker was also praised for insisting on an integrated audience. Baker preferred to distance herself from the Left. Although she took a strong interest in the case of Willie McGee, Baker backed out of a rally in support of McGee when she learned that it was spon- sored by the American Labor Party and that Paul Robeson and radical congressman Vito Marcantonio were also scheduled to speak. Baker was praised for this move by the staunchly anticommunist newsletter Counterattack. Although the State Department was alarmed at Baker's harsh critique of Amer- ican race relations, her notion of social change was not very radical. Baker's under- lying philosophy was that education and respectful interaction among persons of different races and religions would overcome prejudice.  Differences between people were a result of the different circumstances in which they had lived. Baker believed that such differences must be understood and respected. Baker's desire for world harmony was implicitly woven into her signature song, \"J'ai Deux Amours,\" but in a way that was quite personalized. \"I have two loves,\" she sang, \"my country and Paris.\" Baker sometimes tailored her speeches to particular racial and ethnic groups in Argentina. When she spoke to members of the Japanese community in Buenos Aires.",

Despite coming from a society that ridiculed black women as \u2018worthless\u2019, Tyson not just proved it otherwise but also raised the bar for the role of women and their involvement in the entertainment industry. Unlike other actresses who accepted whatever roles came their way, Tyson was extremely choosy about her work. More than often, she flatly refused to do films, or take parts solely for the pay check. She was extremely selective about the roles she chose as she wanted them to have depth and meaning. As such, Tyson\u2019s career trajectory wasn\u2019t always a smooth one.

            "Radical empathy, on the other hand, means putting in the work to educate oneself and to listen with a humble heart to understand another's experience from their perspective, not as we imagine we would feel. Radical empathy is not about you and what you think you would do in a situation you have never been in and perhaps never will. It is the kindred connection from a place of deep knowing that opens your spirit to the pain of another as they perceive it.",
            "Empathy is no substitute for the experience itself. We don't get to tell a person with a broken leg or a bullet wound that they are not in pain. And people who have hit the caste lottery are not in a position to tell a person who has suffered under the tyranny of caste what is offensive or hurtful or demeaning to those at the bottom. The price of privilege is the moral duty to act when one sees another person treated unfairly. And the least that a person in the dominant caste can do is not make the pain any worse."

        "Short Biography": "Born on December 31, 1995, to Timothy Douglas and Natalie Hawkins, Gabby Douglas was destined to be an Olympic gymnastics gold-medalist. At age three, she perfected a straight cartwheel, and by age four, Douglas had taught herself how to do a one-handed cartwheel. Four years later, at age eight, Douglas was named a Virginia State Gymnastics Champion. Committed to improvement, Douglas moved to West Des Moines, Iowa at fourteen to train with renowned coach Liang Chow, who was known for training Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson. Forward to 2012, Douglas won the Olympic Trials and was selected to be a member of the national team to represent the United States at the Summer Olympics in London. Her high-flying skills and the difficulty and skill she accomplished on bars earned her the nickname the \u201cFlying Squirrel.\u201d Douglas was the first African American woman to make the U.S. gymnastics team since 2000 when three-time Olympian Dominique Dawes led the team. At the Summer Olympics, the U.S. won the first gold medal for the American women\u2019s gymnastics team since 1996, and Douglas went on to win gold in the individual all-around event. She was the first African American to win gold in the prestigious event. Douglas became a universal star after the 2012 Summer Olympics, with magazines and cereal brands fighting to plaster her all over their front covers and boxes. Sixteen-year-old Douglas saw herself on the cover of Sports Illustrated, on one of the five covers released by TIME Magazine, and on Kellogg\u2019s special edition box of Wheaties corn flakes. Douglas returned to compete in a second Olympic Games in 2016, sharing gold again with her team that coined themselves \u201cThe Final Five.\u201d Douglas finished the 2016 Summer Olympics with less success than the 2012 Olympics, however, she still stands as one of the most influential American gymnasts and Olympians of her time.",
        "For the culture": "The portrayal of Douglas during the Olympics provided an invaluable lesson to the public to comprehend how race can impact upbringing and an individual\u2019s life. Training in West Des Moines, Iowa, \u201cDouglas noticed right away that she was one of the few black people in town. She was used to standing out. Often, she was the only black gymnast at high-level competitions. However, that situation did not set her apart from her objective and she kept working to improve, a goal that led her to achieve an outstanding result at the Olympics\u201d (1). One on hand, the constant mention of her race was worth noting to show the public how important and monumental her win was, however on the other hand, the constant mention of her race exposed the racism in the reporting of the Olympics. Her race was \u201cturned into a prominent lead\u201d (1). In some newspapers, her identity and her race became more important than her being an incredible athlete.",

        "Short Biography": "Septima Poinsette Clark is a name that is often overlooked and under-appreciated when discussing the Civil Rights Movement. However, Clark\u2019s work is arguably one of the most important in pushing for voting and civil rights for African Americans during this time. Martin Luther King Jr. even credited Clark as \u201cThe Mother of the Movement.\u201d The Civil Rights Movement rallied around the idea that knowledge was one of the most important factors to empower marginalized groups because of Clark\u2019s work as an educator and activist in developing literacy and citizenship workshops. Clark\u2019s activism began early and was prompted by her experiences with growing up in a racist Charleston. Clark was born on May 3, 1898, in Charleston, South Carolina to Peter Porcher and Victoria Warren Anderson Poinsette. As a child, Clark\u2019s father stressed the need for his children to be educated, so in ninth grade, Septima enrolled in the Avery Institute. At the time, all the teachers were white women, and the black teachers that were hired were met with controversy. So, in 1919, in her first political act, Clark led students around the city, going door-to-door asking for signatures on a petition to allow black principals at Avery. In 1920, black teachers were permitted. After, Clark turned her attention to the gross inequality that existed between white and black teachers\u2019 salaries. In 1945, Clark, through the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) worked with Thurgood Marshall on a case regarding equal pay. While Clark made progress with equality in the education system, she is most famous for establishing \u201cCitizenship Schools,\u201d which played an important role in eliminating illiteracy and getting people ready to vote. Without these schools, 25,000 people would not have received education or exercised their right to vote. During this time, Clark became the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) director of education and teaching. She witnessed sexism within the SCLC and the Civil Rights Movement, so she dedicated the Citizenship Schools to fostering women\u2019s self-confidence in their leadership in their communities. Septima Poinsette Clark passed away on December 15, 1987, and her legacy remains one of the most important in the African American struggle for equality.",

        "Short Biography": "Kathleen Cleaver is most famously known for her involvement with the Black Panther Party. Born in 1945 to two activists, Cleaver had an unconventional childhood. Her father, Ernest Neal, accepted a job as director of the Rural Life Council of Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and six years later, joined the Foreign Service. The family then moved abroad and lived in countries such as India, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and the Philippines. From her time abroad, Kathleen was exposed to a variety of different beliefs, including socialism, communism, and nationalism. After returning to America, Cleaver found work with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) after her friend was murdered by white supremacists. It was from here that Cleaver began her activism. In the mid-1960s, Cleaver became the Black Panther Party\u2019s communications secretary. As the first woman member of the Black Panther Party\u2019s Central Committee and assistant editor of the party newspaper, Cleaver was integral in the early development of the party, providing press releases, delivering public speeches, and writing articles about the party. In April 1967, Cleaver organized a student conference at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, where she met her husband and minister of information for the Black Panther Party, Eldridge Cleaver. Eldridge and Kathleen were married in December 1967 and had two kids, Maceo and Joju, two years later. In the time between marriage and kids, Kathleen ran for the 18th District seat in the California State Assembly as a Peace and Freedom Party candidate, and she moved to Algeria to be with Eldridge after he fled the United States following his arrest. In 1971, Kathleen came back to the United States to establish the Revolutionary People\u2019s Communications Network (RPCN) headquarters in New York to unite old and new members of the Black Panther Party. Ten years later, the Cleavers separated and Kathleen moved to New Haven, Connecticut where she attended Yale Law School. After law school, Kathleen became a law clerk for the US Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Pennsylvania, and she served on the Georgia Supreme Court Commission on Racial and Ethnic Bias in the Courts. Since then, Kathleen had taught at several universities, including Emory and Yale, and she has received numerous fellowships at leading institutions including the Bunting Institute of Radcliffe College, the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute of Harvard University, and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York. Today, Kathleen Cleaver continues to teach and be a strong activist for human rights and justice.",

        "Short Biography": "Born in 1916 in Kansas City, Missouri, Florynce (Flo) Kennedy was always taught to rebel against unjust authority. When asked why she entered the legal system and the political sphere, Kennedy retold the same story. In 1919, when Flo Kennedy was just three years old, a group of armed white men came to the Kennedy home and made it clear they did not want the family in their neighborhood. Flo\u2019s mother, Zella, and her father, Wiley, sought legal counsel, but the attorney advised them there was nothing the family could do to stop the threats or to punish the neighbors for harassment. Flo\u2019s parents taught her to defy all forms of oppression and how to be a strong black woman in society. Flo often recounted how her mother encouraged her to challenge the gender limitations placed on black girls and women in the 1920s and 1930s, and how to reject notions of female respectability that limited a black woman\u2019s mobility, pleasure, and sexual expression. From her upbringing, Flo Kennedy became one of the country\u2019s best-known Black feminists, a woman integral in helping to legalize abortion, and a representation of the central role of black feminists in the post-World War II social and political movements. In 1942, Kennedy moved to New York City, and in 1951, she attended Columbia Law School as the only black woman among eight women in her entire class. Her experience at Columbia shaped the way she approached activism. Kennedy used the theory of intersectionality, which emphasizes interlocking systems of oppression by gender and race, to advocate for black feminism and equal rights. Kennedy\u2019s activism began early and she applied her activism to the media, the legal system, and politics. She critiqued sexism and racism in the press and on TV, she took legal cases that discussed either feminism or civil rights, and she worked to create interracial feminist organizations to challenge racism on the same plane as sexism. In 1968, Kennedy played an influential role in the Miss America protest that was used as a tool to demonstrate the exploitation of women. In 1970, Kennedy served as one of the lawyers for the landmark case Abramowitz v. Lefkowitz, which resulted in the repeal of New York\u2019s strict abortion laws. The tactics, used by Kennedy, laid the groundwork for the Roe v. Wade case in 1973 which overturned restrictive abortion laws nationally. Kennedy passed on December 21, 2000, in New York City and will forever be known as one of the key figures to spearhead Black Feminism.",

And if my truth then becomes political, I can't do anything about that ... Age is getting to know all the ways the world turns, so that if you cannot turn the world the way you want, you can at least get out of the way so you won't get run over."

            "The river is constantly turning and bending and you never know where it's going to go and where you'll wind up. Following the bend in the river and staying on your own path means that you are on the right track. Don't let anyone deter you from that ... I never identified with anybody. I have always been very sensitive about my color, because everybody called me 'yellow gal.' I was caught in between both sides - nobody wanted me. I love that my audience is there, but I always feel as though I have to fend for myself."
